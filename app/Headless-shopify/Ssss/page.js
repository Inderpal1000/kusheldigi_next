        <p className="Sss-description">
        Shopify users who choose bundled setups receive a quick deployment of their platform, although
this option provides restricted flexibility because both front-end and backend features remain
integrated.
        </p>

        <p  className="Sss-description">Headless Shopify operates using two disconnected entities that allow frontend management with
your choice of powerful frameworks (such as React, Vue, or Next.js) while Shopify maintains
backend operations, including payment processing and order management and order fulfillment.</p>

        <p className="Sss-descriptionn">
        Benefits of Going Headless:
